 In this post I will explore a few approaches and applications of sound classification. We use both a standard appraoch using spectrograms + CNNs and a more sophisticated approach using transformers on spectrogram patches. We are testing two different methods:
 - Spectogram + CNN (pre-trained AlexNet). Here is the repository: https://github.com/jmhuer/specCNN_sound_classification
 - Spectogram + Transformer (16x16 image patches). Here is the repository: https://github.com/jmhuer/spectogram_transformer

In addition, we did a proof of concept of a system that can detect what kind of activities are going on in a room and change color of a light automatically

## Laugh Detection + Philips Hue Bulb
---

Using AudioSet data we train a laugh detection sound classification and interpret the output for the laugh class as an intensity measure [0,1] to control the intensity of a philips hue bulb

In addition, we did a proof of concept with the robot arm collaborating with a drone to
deliver small food items to a nearby user
There are many applications such as:
