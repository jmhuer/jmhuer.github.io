## Research Experience 

**[*Generating Music by Continuous Neural Network Predictions of Binary Piano Roll Arrays*](http://sdsawtelle.github.io/blog/output/index.html)**
<br>
[Columbia University, Creative Machines Lab](https://github.com/jmhuer) ; Research Advisor  [Hod Lipson](https://github.com/jmhuer)
<br>
*May 2019 -- May 2020*

- This project uses existing piano MIDI to train a Neural Network similar to The Continuous Bag of Words Model combined with a predictive scheme to generate new music, or complete an unfinished piece.

**Example Piano Composition**  
*Based of of Grahms Piano Suite*
