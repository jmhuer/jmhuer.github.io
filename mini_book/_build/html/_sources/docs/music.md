Another alias I make music under. This project is based on a dream I had regarding a burning 5edex truck

## Algorithmic Music
---

This piece was generated using simple instructions requiring any text:

- Any letter that is a note play
- Length of note is determined by counting non-note letter after a note letter
- Two note letters next to each other make the note sharp
- Add and play with instrumentation until it sounds good üôÇ
