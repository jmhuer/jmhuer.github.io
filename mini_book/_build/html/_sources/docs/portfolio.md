## VaryCHarm: Automatically Vary the Complexity of Harmonies in Music

<img src="../../../images/varycharm.png" align="center"/>

<br>

 In this blog post we define the task of varying the harmonic complexity of music automatically along with a baseline method in accordance to music theory. In addition, we propose metrics for evaluation. Experiment to show that our proposed method outperforms other baseline methods.

<br>

In this blog post I share my experience and a few applications of robots and drones for the indoor enviroment. I cover some of the steps required, and provide access to computer vision, and control software. Applications include robot arm and drone with computer vision deliver food to nearby user, robot loads a dishwasher, and robots following humans.

## Shift-Invariant Dictionary Learning for Discovering Music Relations

<img src="../../../images/sidl.png" align="center"/>


<br>

The temporal structure of music is full of shift-invariant patterns (e.g. motifs, ostinatos, loops, etc.). We propose using a Tempo- ral Convolutional Winner-Take-All (CONV- WTA) autoencoder to find a shift-invariant dictionary to represent symbolic, multivariate, musical signals. The model learns to represent fixed length drum beats and variable length pi- ano music. We discuss applications of this sparse representation such as de-noising musi- cal ideas, unsupervised learning of composer styles, and music generation. To assist in re- lated work we include interactive code along with the trained models

<br>

 In this blog post I will explore a few approaches and applications of sound classification. We use both a standard appraoch using spectrograms + CNNs and a more sophisticated approach using transformers on spectrogram patches.

<br>

Data labeling for object detection/segmentation is expensive to acquire.  In this blog post we show we can sped up this proesses of labeling data for certain objects using a thermal camera, and standard computer vision techniques.We can create mask or ROI annotations depending on annotations of interest.
