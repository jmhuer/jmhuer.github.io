## VaryCHarm: Automatically Vary the Complexity of Harmonies in Music

<img src="../../../images/varycharm.png" align="center"/>

<br>

 In this post we define the task of varying the harmonic complexity of music automatically along with a baseline method in accordance to music theory. In addition, we propose metrics for evaluation. Experiment to show that our proposed method outperforms other baseline methods... <sub> <a href="https://jmhuer.github.io/mini_book/_build/html/docs/independent/varycharm.html" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Learn more</a> </sub>

## Robot and Drone Collaboration and Automation

<img src="../../../images/robotautonomy.jpg" align="center"/>

<br>

In this post I share my experience and a few applications of robots and drones for the indoor enviroment. I cover some of the steps required, and provide access to computer vision, and control software. Applications include robot arm and drone with computer vision deliver food to nearby user, robot loads a dishwasher, and robots following humans... <sub> <a href="https://jmhuer.github.io/mini_book/_build/html/docs/independent/robot.html" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Learn more</a> </sub>

## Shift-Invariant Dictionary Learning for Discovering Music Relations

<img src="../../../images/sidl.png" align="center"/>


<br>

The temporal structure of music is full of shift-invariant patterns (e.g. motifs, ostinatos, loops, etc.). We propose using a Tempo- ral Convolutional Winner-Take-All (CONV- WTA) autoencoder to find a shift-invariant dictionary to represent symbolic, multivariate, musical signals. The model learns to represent fixed length drum beats and variable length pi- ano music. We discuss applications of this sparse representation such as de-noising musical ideas, unsupervised learning of composer styles, and music generation. To assist in re- lated work we include interactive code along with the trained models...  <sub> <a href="https://jmhuer.github.io/mini_book/_build/html/docs/independent/sidl.html" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Learn more</a> </sub>

 In this post I will explore a few approaches and applications of sound classification. We use both a standard appraoch using spectrograms + CNNs and a more sophisticated approach using transformers on spectrogram patches...  <sub> <a href="https://jmhuer.github.io/mini_book/_build/html/docs/independent/audioclassification.html" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Learn more</a> </sub>

## Automate Data Labeling using Temperature Differential

<img src="../../../images/thermal.png" align="center"/>


<br>

Data labeling for object detection/segmentation is expensive to acquire.  In this blog post we show we can sped up this proesses of labeling data for certain objects using a thermal camera, and standard computer vision techniques.We can create mask or ROI annotations depending on annotations of interest...  <sub> <a href="https://jmhuer.github.io/mini_book/_build/html/docs/independent/thermal.html" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Learn more</a> </sub>

## Automatic Music Composition and Completion

<img src="../../../images/amcc.png" align="center"/>


<br>

We present a new symbolic approach to auto- matic music generation. First we create a dataset of 62 hours of Mozart music represented by binary piano roll arrays. The dataset is used to train a 1-hidden layer neural network to predict a section of music given the surrounding music. After training we will use our model to continu- ously predict and replace random sections of existing music completely altering the original into what we consider new music....  <sub> <a href="https://jmhuer.github.io/mini_book/_build/html/docs/independent/amcc.html" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Learn more</a> </sub>

Collecting data can be expensive and in certain use cases dangerous to aquire. One such example is smoke data. There are many applications relevant to smoke detection with a camera. To skip the data collection stage we create a synthetic dataset of smoky images...  <sub> <a href="https://jmhuer.github.io/mini_book/_build/html/docs/independent/smoke.html" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Learn more</a> </sub>
