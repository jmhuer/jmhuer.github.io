 In this blog post I will explore a few approaches and applications of sound classification. We use both a standard appraoch using spectrograms + CNNs and a more sophisticated approach using transformers on spectrogram patches.

I worked directly on robotics in the
Emerging Technologies and Innovation group at GE. First we designed a few experiences using a simple
robot arm (Robotic xArm 6DOF). We added a camera and computer vision to allow the arm to reach
for food items.

In addition, we did a proof of concept with the robot arm collaborating with a drone to
deliver small food items to a nearby user
There are many applications such as:
