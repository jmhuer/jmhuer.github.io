 In this blog post I will explain what an SDP is and one application: how to find optimal bridge points using Python libraries: scikit, numpy, pytorch. explain what an SDP is and one application: how to find optimal bridge points using Python libraries: scikit, numpy, pytorch.

## Introduction
---

An SDP (Semidefinite Programming) is a superclass of LP (linear programming). Its called an SDP because the programs can

There are many applications such as:

-   Machine learning and data science
-   Astronomy
-   Artificial intelligence
-   Chemistry
-   Computational biology
