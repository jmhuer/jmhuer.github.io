#  In this blog post I will explore a few approaches and applications of sound classification. We use both a standard appraoch using spectrograms + CNNs and a more sophisticated approach using transformers on spectrogram patches.

# ## Laugh Detection
# ---
# 
# Using AudioSet data we train a laugh detection sound classification and interpret the output for the laugh class as an intensity measure [0,1] to control the intensity of a philips hue bulb

# In addition, we did a proof of concept with the robot arm collaborating with a drone to
# deliver small food items to a nearby user
# There are many applications such as:

# In addition, we did a proof of concept of a system that can detect what kind of activities are going on in a room and change color of a light automatically
