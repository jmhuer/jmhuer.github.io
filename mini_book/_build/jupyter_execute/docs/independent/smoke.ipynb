    "Collecting data can be expensive and in certain use cases dangerous to acquire. One such example is smoke data. There are many applications relevant to smoke detection with a camera. To skip the data collection stage we create a synthetic dataset of smoky images..\n",

    "Synthetic data is information that's artificially manufactured rather than generated by real-world events. Synthetic data is created algorithmically, and it is used as a stand-in for test datasets of production or operational data, to validate mathematical models and, increasingly, to train machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different ways to generate synthetic data. One possibility is to generate a full new image based on a set of examples. In this post we are exploring image alterations NOT full generation.\n",

    "## CycleGANs\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To alter the images, we use  Cycle Generative Adversarial Network, or CycleGAN. This is an approach to training a deep convolutional neural network for image-to-image translation tasks. The Network learns mapping between input and output images using unpaired dataset.\n",
