    "We present a new symbolic approach to auto- matic music generation. First we create a dataset of 62 hours of Mozart music represented by binary piano roll arrays. The dataset is used to train a 1-hidden layer neural network to predict a section of music given the surrounding music. After training we will use our model to continu- ously predict and replace random sections of existing music completely altering the original into what we consider new music.\n",

    "In this paper we are attempting to generate music that utilizes the clarity and low com- putational cost of a symbolic representation while maintaining a good variation and global structure. However unlike the usual approach to generate music we will not use any form of sequence modeling mechanism. Instead we will attempt to create a new sequence of music by altering an existing sequence of music. To accomplish this, we will train a neural network to predict a missing section of music given the surrounding music. After trining, we will use our model to predict and replace sections of existing music.\n",
